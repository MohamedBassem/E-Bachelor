\section{Deduction As a Service}
\subsection{Controlling Client Resources}
\subsection{Clustering and Load Balancing}

\section{Other Work}
\subsection{Supporting Other Languages}
The current implementation of the deduction server accepts only TPTP language.
\subsection{Supporting Other Axiom Pruning Techniques}
The current implementation of the deduction server supports only SinE as the only pruning technique due to the ease of staging and unstaging axiom sets from the algorithm. Staging axiom sets in SinE algorithm is adding their symbol frequency to the distribution and vice versa. Supporting other pruning techniques would be a powerful addition to the deduction server with challenge of finding a way to easily stage and unstage axiom sets.
