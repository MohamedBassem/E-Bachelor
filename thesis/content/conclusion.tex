\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:concl}

We have described the first implementation of the deduction server and the protocol it uses for communication. Our results shows a huge improvement in the run time of sets of related knowledge bases due to the amortization of the costs of parsing and indexing the knowledge bases. This shows the feasibility of the approach.

 In addition to these performance benefits, having a formal protocol to communicate with the prover over the network makes integrating it with other applications much easier. Having access to a remotely running prover is a win for those who cannot install provers locally, e.g. for OS compatibility issues for example or due to insufficient local computing resources.
